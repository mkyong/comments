## A Comment System 

The current WordPress comment system (wpdiscuz) is messy and loaded with a lot of unnecessary stuff; we want to build a new, simple and clean comment system, which includes the following features:

- Design and build a comment form. (Refer to the existing wpdiscuz plugin)
- Basic comment features.
- Anonymous comments allow, with a single compulsory field - Email address
- Responsive UI, support static, dynamic, and mobile sites.
- Include a single .js file able to display the comment form.
- Avoid comment spam (Google captcha API).
- Report and flag features.
- Rate good and bad comments with the number of counts.
- The comment text must support markup tags and pretty-code formatting.
- Front end (React), backend (Java), open for discussion.
- Database, open for discussion.
